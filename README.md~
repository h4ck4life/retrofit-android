RetrofitAndroid is a repackaging of the Square's Retrofit Maven project into a reusable Android library project.

For future reference please refer to the original Github repository

https://github.com/square/retrofit

Usage guides are available in the original Retrofit repository website.

If there are notable differences from the original project, I'll do some remarks accordingly or branch out from this project.

I've done a test Android project based on the library project itself.
